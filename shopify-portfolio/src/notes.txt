ok, so these are the notes for the portfolio site.



TODO: I'm running a netlify version of this page, but it actually all exists on my own server.  

I opted for netflify because I don't trust my devops skills to guarantee that my tiny Linode server isn't going to crash out.

Focus - what's next.

Practice deploying a react app with routes.  

Actually, deploy your front end page.

Clean up Github - put a story on the GiHub page with ANCHOR - 


App work - 
Make the app look nicer - include a header with an image, the summary text of the app, the title of the podcast.  


Bonus App work once everything is done - searching.

Deploy previews in netlify?

TELL THE STORY OF THE APP!  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORANT!!
