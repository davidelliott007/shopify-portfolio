ok, so these are the notes for the portfolio site.



TODO: I'm running a netlify version of this page, but it actually all exists on my own server.  

I opted for netflify because I don't trust my devops skills to guarantee that my tiny Linode server isn't going to crash out.

Focus - what's next.

Practice deploying a react app with routes.  

Actually, deploy your front end page.
